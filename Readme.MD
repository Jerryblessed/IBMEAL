3. **Directly in the SQLite Database**  
   - Users can update the balance manually in the database if needed.  

## GPT-4o Model Integration  
The **GPT-4o model** is used in `worker.py` for query processing.

def __order_menu(self):
    """User menu to order products from the shop."""
    log.debug("Displaying __order_menu")
```
